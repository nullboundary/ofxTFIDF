Anti-government protests have been ongoing in Thailand since the beginning of November 2013. After three years of relative stability, popular demonstrations in Bangkok arose against the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, triggered by a proposed amnesty bill facilitating the return of the self-exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The bill was passed by the Pheu Thai Party-dominated House of Representatives on 1 November, and elicited opposition from both the Democrat Party and the pro-government Red Shirt movement. The bill was turned down by the Senate on 11 November, but protests, led mainly by former Democrat MP Suthep Thaugsuban, continued and gradually turned towards an anti-government agenda.

On 20 November, the Constitutional Court ruled that a proposed amendment to the constitution was invalid, but the Pheu Thai Party rejected the ruling, claiming that the court had no jurisdiction over the case. Anti-government protest numbers swelled over the following weekend, while the Red Shirts also staged counter-protests, now in support of the government. On 25 November, protesters began surrounding and forcing their way into several government offices, forcing their closure. The protests had largely been non-violent, until clashes between anti- and pro-government groups on 30 November and early on 1 December resulted in 4 deaths and 57 wounded. Escalation of protests on 1 December saw two days of clashes between protesters and the police, who used tear gas and water cannons to halt the protesters as they attempted to force their way into the Government House, with 119 people reported injured. On 3 December the police removed their barricades and allowed protesters to enter the site, sharply reducing tensions as part of a temporary truce, in order to allow both sides to celebrate the King's Birthday,[6] although protest leaders said they would continue rallying until their demands to remove "Thaksinocracy" from Thai politics were met.
