The International Religious Freedom Report stated that the Angolan government selectively shut down mosques, schools and community centres.[5] Angolan officials denied that a government had a policy to close mosques, there were reports of local authorities closing mosques or preventing their construction on several occasions.

In July 2010, unidentified arsonists set fire to a mosque in Huambo, causing extensive damage.[7] A Muslim leader later said the mosque was burned "a day after authorities had warned us that we should have not built the mosque where we had and that it had to be built somewhere else."[1]

On September 4, 2010, authorities closed a mosque in Cazenga without prior notice or justification. The mosque reopened a month later.[8]

In November 2011, Angolan authorities tore down a structure being used a mosque in Cacuaco without notice and without a written order of violation.[9] In December 2011, a Muslim group in the Malanje Province purchased some land, and applied to obtain permission to build a mosque. The Muslim group repeatedly asked the authorities to either grant or deny the application, but received no response. After waiting several months, when the Muslim group began construction, Angolan authorities arrived and destroyed the mosque foundation. The authorities did not provide either a denial of the application, or a citation for offense.[9]

In January 2012, the Angolan government prevented Muslims from building a mosque in Dundo, Lunda Norte Province, even though the Muslim group had a license to do so. In May 2012, the police chained the doors of a building used by Muslims as a mosque and told them to cease praying there. Muslim leaders wrote letters in response, but received no response.[5]

According to the Islamic Community of Angola, a total of 60 mosques, mostly outside of Luanda, have been shut down in 2013. Voice of America reported seeing a video that showed the demolition of a mosque in Saurimo.[10]

Angolan Minister of Culture said "The legalisation of Islam has not been approved...their mosques will be closed until further notice."[11] The Angolan Embassy in the United States said it was not aware of this remark.[12][3] A spokesperson for the Angolan police said that he was unaware of any government order to shut down mosques. However, Voice of America found a government document telling official to demolish the "Zango 1" mosque in Viana Luanda province.[10]

"Ban on Islam" controversy

In November 2013, some media sources reported that Islam had been outlawed in Angola, as well as other belief systems deemed to be contrary to the country's culture.[4][13][14] The International Business Times said that Angola was seeking to shut down all mosques.[11]

However, the reports were later denied by the government[12][3] The Ministry of Culture stated, "There is no war in Angola against Islam or any other religion."[15]

Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) , said that it will be sending a fact-finding team to prepare a report on the situation.[16]
